\chapter{Introduction}\label{structure}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Release of ChatGPT, Bing, Bard.. (links to models)
  \item Chatbots are becoming more and more popular
  \item Domain of question answering, especially medical domain
  \item Evaluation of models is important
  \item Evaluation of chatbots is hard and still lacking
  \item Usually only done on Multiple Choice tasks or human evaluation \cite{singhal:2022}
  \item Human evaluation is expensive and time consuming
  \item Multiple choice tasks are not really representative of a real conversation
  \item We propose a new metric for evaluating chatbots based on information retrieval techniques
  \item Dataset from \cite{goeuriot:2021}
  \item Use it to evaluate different chatbots
  \item Show that it's able to capture number of model parameters
\end{itemize}
