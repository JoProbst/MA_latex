        \caption{The different annotations for the sample web document in the dimensions of relevance, credibility and readability.
        The document was annotated by different people for different queries, resulting in different annotations for the same document.
        While this makes sense for the relevance dimension, it is not ideal for the credibility and readability dimensions, as those should be consistent across queries.}
